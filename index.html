            <p>To make you feel close to home even when you're far away, I'll be adding a new video every single week just for you. Whether it's a funny moment, a sweet message, or a surprise that will make you smile, these videos are my way of reminding you that you're always in my thoughts, no matter where you are.</p>

        <h2>A Letter</h2>
        <div class="letter">
            <p>Honor, sometimes I struggle to put into words how I'm truly feeling inside; sometimes I say things without thinking of how you will take it. But please know I love you with all my heart, and I'm thankful every day that I meet you.</p>
            <p>I know you're not always self-confident and struggle daily to be happy with who you are. You feel the way you do, not because you've done anything wrong but because of other people's actions. But I (and I think most other people) see you for who you truly are: a kind, intelligent, beautiful, sexy, caring, funny, selfless human being who never hesitates to put her friends and loved ones before herself, sometimes at the expense of herself and her health!</p>
            <p>Life never really works out how we plan it to; we all have setbacks, things that knock us down, and we meet people we wish we had never met and we have experiences we wish we'd never happened. Four Months ago, I didn't really know what I wanted to do in my life, but now I do. That's how life works I suppose.</p>
            <p>I know you are nervous about Australia; it would be weird if you weren't, to be honest. But you're going to experience something most of us never get to; You're going to see some amazing "stuff and things", and you're going to make some amazing friends along the way; you are obviously nervous about the dangers over there, but you will be with a large group, you know every precaution to take, and both your friends and I will be checking up on you, and you're location every god damn hour of the day üòâ</p>
            <p>If, at times, you feel homesick, I'll always be at the other end of a phone or an e-mail inbox (alex.orr104@mod.gov.uk). Even during work time, you never need to feel scared to ask me something, and you never need to feel like you're pestering me; I want to hear every little thing that you get up to out there!</p>
            <p>Now, you may be wondering why that is. Well, that brings me back to paragraph 3 "Four Months ago, I didn't really know what I wanted to do in my life, but now I do" I want to spend the rest of my life with you; I want to one day get married, I want to one day have children with you, I want to live forevermore with you till we die together at 100 years old.</p>
            <p>So even though we are as far away on this earth as physically possible from each other, I've never felt closer to someone in my life.</p>
            <p>I'll be waiting for you when you get back ready to have a hug,</p>
            <p>I Love You 3033</p>
